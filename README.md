Current issues with comments page:
1. when you click on the [comment] button on a match, it doesn't take you to that match by default, it takes you to match 1 always (just add parameter and it should be fixed)
2. when you refresh the app and go to the comments page, the commits dont get automatically filled in, you have refresh the page by clicking the match again
3. *IMPORTANT:* When you submit comments and then go to another match and then come back to that match, the comments get unsubmitted, fix needed otherwise dysfunctional
