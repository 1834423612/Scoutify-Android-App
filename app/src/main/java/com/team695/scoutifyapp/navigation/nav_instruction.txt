Okay the way i set this up is the navbar is static and then you display an AppNav()
composable which gets modified by the different routes. See NavRail and AppNav for the changed code.

Also, the current logic for the buttons on the navbar is that it only changes the color of
the buttons if you click on the button. So in the case that you go the homepage from a button on the
data collection page, the navbar will still think you're on the data collection page and make that
button blue.

You can fix this in the NavRail by using this psuedologic for all the NavItems parameter named 'selected'
'selected' equal to
selected = currentNavBarRoute == "name of route".
